The recipient can see this address in the sender information and can also reply directly to this address. The standard address is also transferred and can be used for incoming status notifications, for example.When sending using an RFC node in SAPconnect, the standard address of the communication type used is the one set as the sender address. The structure defined in the case of the RFC does not permit another address to be transferred, so the standard address is used for incoming status notifications too.The SAP users have the addresses of their exchange P.O. boxes in their standard communication type 'Internet Mail' as the home address and their Internet address in the SAP system as their standard address. Example:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address the user receives directly in the exchange postbox.Sending using the RFC nodeThe standard address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@System.Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address, it arrives back to the SAP system.Example using a mail system groupThe users should get all messages in their Microsoft Exchange postboxes. In the SAP system the mail system group is activated for this using the setting \"Send Messages to the Home Address\".The address settings of the SAP users remain unchanged:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address the user receives directly in the exchange postbox.Sending using the RFC nodeThe standard address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@System.Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address it arrives back in the SAP system. It is then forwarded using the mail system group to the home address and the user gets it in the exchange postbox."

For this, the system checks invoices that have been held or parked or that contain errors, or invoices that were entered for invoice verification in the background.

Compared against the invoice entered earlier, the invoice just entered has different values in the characteristics Reference and Company Code. However, these characteristics are not checked due to the settings that you have made in Customizing. All other characteristics are the same.
